# demo setup

There are two simple scripts that are used in demo setup.
The script [xinitrc.show](https://github.com/CESNET/eduroam-live/blob/master/setup/xinitrc.show) is used to setup the X window system and both
browser windows with applications.

The second [script](https://github.com/CESNET/eduroam-live/blob/master/setup/sl.sh) just creates a terminal with endless steam locomotive animation.
This script must be ran manually after the demo is set up.
